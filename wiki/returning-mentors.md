title:  Returning Mentors

*more details coming soon*

## How do I get to be a returning mentor?

- looking for people who have made a career change
- very competitive, about 35 applications, choose 4 or 5 depending on funding (from each institution)

## Expected Behavior

Returning mentors are part of the summer school staff.
They should act professionally and understand that they act like a role model for the students.

Mentors should try to be outgoing and social.
Large, intense, social activities for the summer school can be intimidating for some students.
Try to be your most social self and try to engage with any students who may be sitting alone.

## Duties

The returning mentors have a number of responsibilities before and during the summer school.

- **Tech Lightning Talk**:
  On Monday, each returning mentor gives a 2 minute lightning talk about their technical work.
  If the mentor chooses to use slides, they must be timed to auto-advance.
- **Career Lightning Talk**:
  On Friday, each returning mentor gives a 2 minute lightning talk about their career path since the summer school.
  There are no slides used for this session.
- **Poster Session Organization**:
  Returning mentors are responsible for coordinating the student poster sessions.
  This involves gathering the student titles and abstracts before the summer school starts.
- **Hands-on Session Help**:
  For each hands-on session a returning mentor will be tasked with being the main assistant, but *all* returning mentors are expected help during these sessions.
  The assigned returning mentor will be in charge of handing-out and collecting the post-it notes.
