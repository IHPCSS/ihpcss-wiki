title: "Mentoring Overview"
---

The Summer School staff includes returning mentors (people who are previous IHPCSS students), presenters, and organizers.
Most staff members act as mentors to the students attending the summer school.

## Mentoring Groups

Mentor groups are assigned in June and consist of 1 staff member (the mentor) and 3-4 students (the mentees).
These groups are assigned based on the responses from the matching surveys.
While we do our best to match based on mutual interests, if you find that you and your mentor aren’t compatible, please talk with other mentors instead, or raise this with the mentoring team (Scott/Weronika). 
Our goal is not to force you to stay with the mentor you were assigned to, but rather that you have a positive mentoring experience.
Even if you and your assigned mentor are a good match, we encourage you to talk with other staff members for a variety of perspectives and expertise.

## Mentoring Activities

Before the Summer School starts, we will ask mentoring groups to complete an ice-breaker activity; it will help you to get to know your mentor and fellow mentees a little better.

At the Summer School, there will be both formal mentoring opportunities (as outlined in the schedule) and informal opportunities (e.g., meals, the poster session, and evening activities).
During the formal mentoring activities, you will be expected to interact with your mentor and/or mentoring group.
We encourage all students to take advantage of the informal mentoring opportunities by interacting with other staff and peers.

After the Summer School, the formal mentoring relationship is over.
We encourage students and mentors to keep in touch, but it is not required.

## Common Questions

### Why should I participate?

- Gain access to a new network of contacts
- Get a broader diversity of perspectives than your own advisor or department
- Learn from someone else’s experiences
- Obtain help in achieving your goals
- Improve your self-confidence
 
### What can I do to get the most out of mentoring?

Much of this information is taken from an invaluable resource: *Adviser, Teacher, Role Model, Friend: On Being a Mentor to Students in Science and Engineering* (1997).

- Keep in touch with your mentor before, during, and after the Summer School.
  You may not have burning questions at all times, but reaching out to your mentor will help you establish a good relationship with them.
- Ask your mentor any questions you may have -- don’t hold back!
  Even if your mentor doesn’t have the answer, he or she can help you find another mentor in our community who can answer your question.
- Feel free to disagree with your mentor, question your mentor, or ask for clarification.
  They can only assess how helpful they are if you give feedback.
- Your mentor is there to help you to think through your options and help you to formulate your plans.
  You make the decisions and you take the responsibility.
- Always seek mentoring in a public space.
- Reach out beyond your assigned mentor.
  Getting a variety of opinions from multiple mentors is a great idea.
- Talk to the mentoring team (Scott/Weronika) if you are not happy with your mentoring group.

### What should I avoid?

- Assuming that because technical areas differ, your mentor’s advice is not applicable.
- Assuming that your mentor cannot possibly understand your situation.  
  Give them a chance -- you might be surprised!
- Assuming your mentoring match will be perfect.
  No match is perfect and your mentor may only be able to help you with some of your issues, this does not mean that the partnership will not work.
  Discuss your aims and goals; find out the strengths of your mentor and the areas in which your mentor feels able to assist.
 
### What should you talk about with your mentor?

You will have many opportunities to talk to your mentor and fellow mentees, and the better prepared you are the more you will benefit from them. You should spend some time thinking what it is that you want to talk with your mentor about.
 
Things you may want to talk about include:
- How to organise your time and responsibilities;
  How to achieve a work-life balance
- Personal and professional challenges -- how to make the best out of them
- What to expect from working in the industry/academia/government/etc.
- How to adapt to working in an international setting or another country
- How to find funding;
  How to get access to HPC resources
- Different working arrangements -- What is it like to work from home/work remotely?
- Professional etiquette
- How to talk to people;
  How to effectively build your network
- How to deal with people issues at work (e.g., problems with your advisor, manager, confrontations, etc.)
- How to succeed in a job interview
