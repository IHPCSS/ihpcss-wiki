The Summer School staff includes returning mentors (people who are previous IHPCSS students), presenters, and organizers.
Most staff members act as mentors to the students attending the summer school.

## Mentoring Groups

Mentor groups are assigned in June and consist of 1 staff member (the mentor) and 3-4 students (the mentees).
These groups are assigned based on the responses from the matching surveys.
While we do our best to match based on mutual interests, if you find that you and your mentor arenâ€™t compatible, please talk with other mentors instead, or raise this with the mentoring team (Scott/Weronika).
Our goal is not to force you to stay with the mentor you were assigned to, but rather that you have a positive mentoring experience.
Even if you and your assigned mentor are a good match, we encourage you to talk with other staff members for a variety of perspectives and expertise.

## Mentoring Activities

Before the Summer School starts, we will ask mentoring groups to complete an [ice-breaker activity](https://ihpcss.github.io/wiki/ice-breaker.html); it will help you to get to know your mentor and fellow mentees a little better.

At the Summer School, there will be both formal mentoring opportunities (as outlined in [the schedule](https://ihpcss.github.io/wiki/mentoring-schedule.html)) and informal opportunities (e.g., meals, the poster session, and evening activities).
During the formal mentoring activities, you will be expected to interact with your mentor and/or mentoring group.
We encourage all students to take advantage of the informal mentoring opportunities by interacting with other staff and peers.

After the Summer School, the formal mentoring relationship is over.
We encourage students and mentors to keep in touch, but it is not required.
