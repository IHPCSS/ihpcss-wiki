As part of your IHPCSS experience, we ask that all participants prepare an electronic poster for presentation on Monday or Tuesday evening. This is information you will share with your colleagues via your own laptop computer.

You MUST submit your title and abstract ahead of time.  If you have not done this yet, one of our returning mentors will be contacting you shortly to request your title and abstract.

The information may include one or more of the following:

    • At most 5 PowerPoint slides or web pages that convey your research work.
    • Content similar to what you might traditionally include on a paper poster: abstract of research, people/institutions involved, progress to date, findings, future plans.
    • A demo of your research software in action which may include running the model and/or showing a visualization from your project.

Remember that most of the attendees are familiar with HPC but not with your domain science, so be prepared to explain your contributions to someone outside your field.

In addition, we ask that you give a lightning talk at the start of your poster session.  These brief talks will help other students get an overview of your work, so that interested students can plan to talk with you in more detail during the poster session.  In preparing your lightning talk, please observe the following guidelines:

    • Your talk should be no more than 1 minute in length.
    • There will be no capability to present slides, so plan to talk without visuals.
    • A good place to start is to summarize your abstract, remembering to emphasize the HPC aspects of your work.
    • Feel free to use a prop if you think it will help you communicate. 

You will be assigned a location and one of the four sessions, either the first half or second half of Monday or Tuesday evening. Plan to stand by your electronic poster for about 1 hour on your assigned night.  When not presenting we expect attendees to learn about other participants' work.

There are NO facilities available for paper posters – please DO NOT bring paper posters. We plan to post all electronic poster materials online for ongoing sharing among all of the participants.

If you have any questions about posters, please contact Scott Callaghan at scottcal@usc.edu.
