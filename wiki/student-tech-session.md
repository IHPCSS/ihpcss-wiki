title:  Student Technical Sessions
---

The student technical sessions are an opportunity for each student to:
- practice a 1 minute pitch about their technical work,
- show off a few slides or demonstrate some interesting visuals,
- engage in networking with others both in- and out-side of their technical field.

The dress code is business casual.
We understand that all students are traveling and formal attire (such as a suit) is not required.

## Format

Each student will be assigned to one of 4 sessions, each of which lasts about 1 hour.
The students presenters should come prepared with a few slides, visuals, or something to demonstrate about their technical work.
Each presenter will have a station where they will be able to stand next to their laptop.

At the start of each session all presenters will give a 1 minute lightning pitch about the technical work they are presenting.
At a minimum, this should include the student's name, institution, and poster title.
Students should use this opportunity to practice a elevator-pitch for a general scientific audience.

The rest of the session will be an open format.
Non-presenters (students and staff) will visit the presenter stations.
Students are encouraged to engage with other outside of their technical field.
